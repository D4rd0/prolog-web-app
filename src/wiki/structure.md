# BlueCar project structure

Â¡Welcome to our BlueCar proyect! This README is designed to give you an overview of the project structure, facilitating your understanding and navigation as you explore and contribute to the code.

## Project structure

In this project, we have organized the code in a logical and easy-to-follow manner. Here is a quick look at the directory structure:

- **Components**: A component is a fundamental building block of our web application, is a self-contained module that encapsulates both the logic and the user interface of a specific part of a web application. Inside this folder we find:

  - _Elements_ folder contains small, reusable components that play a crucial role in maintaining design consistency and functionality across the application. These components, such as buttons, icons, or form elements, are utilized in multiple areas to streamline development and enhance user experience.

  - A folder for each main component of the project. Each one is a special building block that does a specific job

- **Assets**: Here we store all images used in the application and also some css styles.

- **Utils**: Is reserved to store functions and utilities shared in the whole application.

- **Interfaces**: Is used to store all TypeScript interfaces in our project.

- **Storage**: This folder is used to handle the global state of the project using redux.

- **Tests** : **_WIP_**

### 1. Components

Inside this folder _components_ we can find more folders, one of each big view in the project. These views have been separated to make it easier to navigate between components and to optimize the code in a simpler way.

First of all we can find the first folder:

- **Elements**: Where is stored all the basic and generic components that are shared in all the application. These components are usually simple visual elements that are used in various parts of the user interface. Some exaples are a Tag, the card of a trip, the card of details of a trip...

- Then there are the **folders with the main views** with the descriptive name of the view: These in turn are made up of two folders:

  - **Container** : where the main logic of the page and the more general database calls reside. Separating this logic into containers facilitates modularization and maintenance. With this we reduce the number of calls to the api, with which we manage to remove the load of calls and components.
  - **Components**: They are all the parts that form the container, where the local state of the component is managed. Components are useful because you can easily reuse them in different parts of your site, making it easier to build and understand.

> An example in our project is **_PublishTrip_**.Composed of container and components folders. Inside this the _container folder_, here the call to the database is made to obtain the pubilshed or reserved trips, according to the type of page that is wanted, also call all the related components with the necessary props. And on the other side is the _components folder_ where the components of the container are. In our case there is only one so it is called publishTripComponent: Here we manage the status of the trip listing

### 2. Assets

Here we can find two different folders:

- **Images** : Contains images used in the user interface

- **Styles** : Contains CSS style sheets or related files

### 3. Utils

In the **utils folder** are all the methods that are used multiple times
These utilities are usually auxiliary functions that are not directly related to specific components or to the management of the global state, but that are necessary in diverse places of the code.

> Some examples are methods to get the time of a tavel, format a date...

### 4. Interfaces

Here, as described above, you will find all the general **interfaces** used in the project. In _TypeScript_ the interfaces define the form of an object, providing the set of properties it has.

### 5. Storage

In this folder you will find all the logic related to **Redux**. This is described extensively in another file where it is explained how Redux works in our project.

### 6. Tests
